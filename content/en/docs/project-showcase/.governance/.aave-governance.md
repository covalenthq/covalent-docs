# Aave Governance Dashboard

### Website

<Aside>

"It was easy to use the Covalent API and it saved me a lot of work and time. I achieved my goal with a single endpoint. Also, it made me realize that I can query multiple chains just by changing the parameters and that in itself I think is amazing."

</Aside>

&nbsp;
### Use of Covalent API
Once the user logs in, the app fetches the balances corresponding to that user's Ethereum address in order to compute its Aave voting power and display it.

The endpoint used in order to get the necessary data in JSON format was:
`GET /v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/balances_v2/`

### Event

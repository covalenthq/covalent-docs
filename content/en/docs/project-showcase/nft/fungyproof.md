### Website
https://fungyproof.com/

&nbsp;

The value of an NFT is derived from its story. This story includes how it’s minted, press events, certifications and more, however, there isn’t a way to immutably tie that data from multiple sources to a token or view it all in one place. 

FungyProof enables owners to validate, add and showcase all the value attributed to an NFT over time with a user-friendly UI inspired by collectible grading services.

<Aside>

“The Covalent API is an incredible resource for early-stage products. By using Covalent developers can skip node infrastructure entirely and focus their efforts on their product. Covalent is also one of the only APIs which currently offers robust NFT data.”

</Aside>

&nbsp;
### Use of Covalent API
We use Covalent API to retrieve a list of NFTs that an address has available in their wallet. We also check the NFT data (including metadata) against ours as a backup to our data aggregation services.

### Event
The project was built at [EthGlobal - HackFS 2021](https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/hackfs-winners-announcment/)

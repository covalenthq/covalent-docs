“Covalent API is very straight forward and easy to plug in with Axios!”

### Use of Covalent API
The V1 of PixelProperty has been on mainnet since 2018. The PixelProperty team wanted to make it cross-chain and remove dependency on the Etheruem full node they were running. For historic data, the contract emits a SetColors event when drawing, and one of our features is creating a timelapse. 

A SQLite3 database was created for saving events that have been requested (to reduce re-requests on the API), and it iterates through all the events propagated by the mainnet contract, and saves them into a local database which can then be quickly query when needed.

### Event
The project was built at [#ETHGlobal - Scaling Ethereum](https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/scaling-ethereum-winners/)

&nbsp;

### Use of Covalent API
FTM Scan is an address scanner that fetches the balance, transactions and NFTs on Fantom Opera (Mainnet) and Testnet.

It uses the following Covalent API endpoints:
- [`Get token balances for address`](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/balances_v2/) To fetch the address balances.
- [`Get transactions`](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/transactions_v2/) To fetch all the address transactions.
- [`Get external NFT metadata`](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/tokens/{contract_address}/nft_metadata/{token_id}/) To fetch NFT metadata.

### Event
The project was built at [#OneMillionWallets - Fantom 2021](https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/omw-fantom-winners/)

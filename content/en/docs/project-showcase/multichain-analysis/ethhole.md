### Use of Covalent API
EthHole is convenient for getting tokens info with price in an address. Using the Covalent API endpoint `Get token balances for address` returning responses in JSON format. Covalent API was super convenient in bootstrapping the project as they needed to handle multiple addresses, it saved lots of effort to query balances of each token, and find related prices.

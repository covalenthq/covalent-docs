"We built a function for a reusable Chainlink External Adapter for an iterative Covalent job that tracks interactions to a specific protocol's contract."

A protocol for Profit-Sharing Economy as a Service - allowing any Decentralized Protocol to bootstrap their Web3-Native Economy on the Polygon Network.

### Note from the Developers

Profit-sharing is the single, most important step towards Progressive Decentralization and truly autonomous  communities. The d-Pad Caf√© makes it a 2-step process for you to kick-off an automated, Web3-Native Profit-Sharing Agreement. Measure the exact interaction rate of each user/participant to your protocol, and let our Quadratic Distribution model ensure a fair reward to anyone. You & your founding team included!

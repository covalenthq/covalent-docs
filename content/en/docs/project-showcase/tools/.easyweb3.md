Easy Web3 is a website builder, which allows non-coder to build a website powered by web3 technology. Users are able to drag and drop web3 enabled component into the canvas to access to the web3 world, such as embed Livepeer stream, music player based on Audius tracks, NFT content on Zora, and coin price. Easy Web3 also integrate Unlock, which can hide certain content behind paywall. Once users are done with editors, they can also click a button and push the website to IPFS.

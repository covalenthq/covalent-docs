### Added

- Integrated [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/) chain! Fantom is a high-performance, scalable, customizable, and secure smart-contract platform. Fantom is permissionless, decentralized, and open-source while achieving fast finality (1-2 second transaction confirmation) and low fees ($0.00001). Furthermore, Fantom is EVM-compatible. `ChainID: 250`. `<multichain>`

- SushiSwapService Feature - Add swaps to Get Sushiswap address exchange liquidity transactions. `<data-accessibility>`

- Added NFT support for OPENSEA store front, Rariable, Zora, Hashmasks, Cryptopunks. With new endpoints. `<data-accessibility>`

  - Get external NFT metadata `/v1/{chain_id}/tokens/{address}/nft_metadata/{token_id}/`
  - Get NFT Token IDs `/v1/{chain_id}/tokens/{address}/nft_token_ids/`
  - Get NFT Transactions `/v1/{chain_id}/tokens/{address}/nft_transactions/{token_id}/`

- New Endpoint `/v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/portfolio_v2/` to Calculate historical portfolio value over time. With this new feature, organizations can get the USD value of all the ERC20 tokens in their wallet over the last 30 days with a 24 hour granularity. `<data-accessibility>`

- [Avalanche C-Chain](https://www.avalabs.org/) has been indexed and is now ready for production use case. We are thrilled to be supporting [Avalanche](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/avalanche). Avalanche is the first smart contracts platform that confirms transactions instantly, supports the entirety of the Ethereum development toolkit, and enables millions of independent validators to participate as full block producers. `<multichain>`

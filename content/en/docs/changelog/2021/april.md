### Fixed

- Fix `TokenBalanceService` - Use PricingServiceV2 quote rates [Issue-594](https://github.com/covalenthq/scout/issues/594)

- PricingService - Historical Prices - ensure that yesterday is populated when we transition into today using UTC [Issue-557](https://github.com/covalenthq/scout/issues/557)

- Fix `TokenBalanceService` and `TokenTransferService` in Avalanche portfolio returns http 500 error message. [Issue-530](https://github.com/covalenthq/scout/issues/530)

- Fix parameterize pancake swap by setting Switch chain_id for the router [Issue-527](https://github.com/covalenthq/scout/issues/527)

- Fix Uniswap v2 streamify swaps returns http 500 error message. [Issue-524](https://github.com/covalenthq/scout/issues/524)

- Pricing service fix to add price changes in WETH. [Issue-511](https://github.com/covalenthq/scout/issues/511)

- Auto Calculate starting block fix: Allow the user to put in `latest` with no starting_block. So it is auto-calculated as `latest-1000000`. That way the user doesn't have to always look up the starting block. [Issue-431](https://github.com/covalenthq/scout/issues/431)

- Pricing service refactoring - Code refactoring to move components into separate particular functions. "Getting historical prices by address" changed to a cleaner flow using switch statements. Can now be done in 2 blocks. [Issue-339](https://github.com/covalenthq/scout/issues/339)

- Fix Primer Exceptions should be typed: Primer exceptions are now less generic. Most of them are JSONParseExceptions but we also created a few more specific ones for other cases. [Issue-332](https://github.com/covalenthq/scout/issues/332)

- Primer enabled on all class A endpoints. Added two query parameters: `match` - to filter responses. `primer` - to filter, aggregate, sort, limit responses. [Issue-323](https://github.com/covalenthq/scout/issues/323)

## 2022-04-30

### ADDED
- We’ve added a ‘fees paid’ field to our transaction endpoint that allows users to see the actual amount of gas paid for any transaction. 

### UPDATED
- We’ve updated our `xy=k` endpoints by adding an additional day to the date field in order to allow users to calculate percentage changes over 7 day and 30 day timeframes. 

### BUG FIXES

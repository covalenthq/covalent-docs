## 2022-04-30

### ADDED
- We’ve added a ‘fees paid’ field to our [transaction endpoint](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#/0/Get%20transactions%20for%20address/USD/1) that allows users to see the actual amount of gas paid for any transaction. 

### UPDATED
- We’ve updated our [`xy=k`](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#/0/0/USD/1) endpoints by adding an additional day to the date field in order to allow users to calculate percentage changes over 7 day and 30 day timeframes. 

### BUG FIXES

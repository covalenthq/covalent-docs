Critical to the Covalent Network are the Network Operators. These act as points of presence on the network that fulfil various duties necessary to enable a decentralized blockchain data indexing and querying model. Each operator is compensated in CQT for the work performed.

Network Operators may function in one or all of the live network roles. The roles have very different operational requirements and duties. It is expected that node-operators will self-select into the subset of roles that best suit their capabilities.

Currently, whitelisted operators are only operating as Block-Specimen Producers. As the network is developed, this whitelist will expanded and overtime, extinguished. Furthermore, as other roles beyond Block Specimen Producers are developed and go live, operators will be able to expand into such.

#### Live Roles**

- Block-Specimen Producer

#### In Development**

- Refiner
- Storage-Request Responder
- Query Operator
- Directory Service Node

### Operator Expectations

- Reliable connection to the Covalent Network (low latency, high uptime)
- Robust security practices and network architecture
- Meet the staking parameters
- Running latest Covalent Network Node software releases
- Participation in governance (when applicable)

### Staking Parameters

- The minimum staking amount for a validator is 175,000 CQT.
- There is an unbonding period of 180 days for validators. During this period, rewards cease to be added to the principal amount staked.
- The fees which delegates pay to validators can be changed by the owner and has a minimum of 2%. It can be different for each validator.
- There is a maximum ratio of delegated CQT to validator-staked CQT. The ratio can be changed by the contract owner and will be set to 10:1 at launch.

Critical to the Covalent Network are the Network Operators. These act as points of presence on the network that fulfil various duties necessary to enable a decentralized blockchain data indexing and querying model. Each operator is compensated in CQT for the work performed.

Network Operators may function in one or all of the live network roles. The roles have very different operational requirements and duties. It is expected that node-operators will self-select into the subset of roles that best suit their capabilities.

Currently, whitelisted operators are only operating as Block-Specimen Producers. As the network is developed, this whitelist will expanded and overtime, extinguished. Furthermore, as other roles beyond Block Specimen Producers are developed and go live, operators will be able to expand into such.

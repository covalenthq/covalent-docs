# Aurora Network

## Introduction
Aurora is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implemented as a smart contract on NEAR Protocol.
Aurora is a solution, that allows developers to execute Ethereum contracts in a more performant environment: The NEAR blockchain. NEAR is a modern layer-1 blockchain which is fast with 2-3 second transaction finalization time, scalable, and carbon neutral. 

Aurora supports all tools available in the Ethereum ecosystem â€” MetaMask, Truffle, Hardhat, Remix, etc. Additionally, NEAR's trustless bridge to Ethereum means even the assets on Aurora are the same as Ethereum.

## Supported endpoints

<Aside>

All __Class A__ endpoints are supported for the HECO mainnet and the HECO testnet. You can query either network via the unified API by changing the `chainId`.

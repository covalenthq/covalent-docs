# Palm

## Introduction

[Palm](https://palm.io/) is a new NFT ecosystem for Culture and Creativity, built efficiently with Ethereum.

Palm NFT Studio collaborates with creatives, artists, marketplaces, and rights holders to bring projects and platforms into the Palm ecosystem.

Together, with some of the biggest names in fine art, cryptoart, and entertainment, Palm is building a new creative studio and NFT ecosystem on Ethereum that is both scalable and sustainable.

Creators using the Palm ecosystem will benefit from super low gas fees, and the Palm ecosystem will reward both creators and participants. The Palm ecosystem was designed from the ground up to be as flexible as artists are creative.

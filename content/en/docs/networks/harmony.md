# Harmony

## Introduction

[Harmony](https://harmony.one) is an open and fast blockchain. The production mainnet supports 4 shards of 1000 nodes, capable of running Ethereum applications with 2-second transaction finality, and 1000 times lower fees than Ethereum.

Harmony is your open platform for assets, collectibles, identity, governance. The secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum, Binance and 3 other chains.

Harmony's Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) reduces centralization while supporting stake delegation, reward compounding and double-sign slashing.

Harmony aims to build an open network of nodes operated and governed by a large community. This node community is called Pangaea.

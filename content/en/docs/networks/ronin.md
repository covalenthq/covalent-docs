# Ronin Network

## Introduction

Axie Infinity is a Pok√©mon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets. Axie was built as a fun and educational way to introduce the world to blockchain technology.

In order for Axie Infinity to reach omore connections (the friends and family of our friends and family of users) Axie is building a long term solution that makes participating in the Axie game & economy, fast, cheap, and seamless: Ronin.

Ronin is an Ethereum-linked sidechain made specifically for Axie Infinity. A Ronin was a samurai without a master in feudal Japan and Ronin represents the Axie desire to take the destiny of our product into our own hands.

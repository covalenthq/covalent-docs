# IoTeX

## Introduction

[IoTeX](https://iotex.io/) is a blockchain-based platform, designed to become the decentralized backbone for Internet of Things applications. 

With an ever-growing ecosystem of projects and products from DeFi to Tools to Gaming, IoTeX currently leads the worldâ€™s premier industry consortiums and standards bodies such as IEEE, IIC, and more. With numerous contributions to the Blockchain and IoT space, the IoTeX blockchain already powers real devices, including Ucam, an award-winning blockchain-powered cameras presented at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and the Pebble geo device. Pebble is a secure device designed by IoTeX and perfect for supply chain optimization in any industry. As a next step, IoTeX is launching "MachineFi" , to power next-gen IoT applications.

<!-- <Definitions>

- `api.covalenthq.com/v1/{chainId}/address/{address}/balances_v2/` 
  - Get token balances for `address`. Return a list of all ERC20 and NFT token balances including ERC721 and ERC1155 along with their current spot prices.

- `api.covalenthq.com/v1/{chainId}/address/{address}/transactions_v2/` 
  - Retrieve all transactions for `address` including their decoded log events. This endpoint does a deep-crawl of the blockchain to retrieve all kinds of transactions that references the address.

- `api.covalenthq.com/v1/{chainId}/address/{address}/transfers_v2/` 
  - Get ERC20 token transfers for `address` alongwith historical token prices.

- `api.covalenthq.com/v1/{chainId}/tokens/{contract_address}/token_holders/` 
  - Return a paginated list of token holders `contract_address` as of any historical block height.

- `api.covalenthq.com/v1/{chainId}/events/address/{contract_address}/` 
  - Return a paginated list of decoded log events emitted by a particular smart contract.

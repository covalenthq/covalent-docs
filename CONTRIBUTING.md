Contributing
------------

Please refer to the project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** to the `development` branch so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from the `development` branch before making a PR!

Request both [@emmaodia](https://github.com/emmaodia) and [@harishraisinghani](https://github.com/harishraisinghani) as reviewers on your PR.

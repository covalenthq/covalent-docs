The new endpoints provide both a global view of NFT collections ranked by market cap, as well as a detailed view of historical sale and floor price information for a particular collection. Thus far, it’s been hard to understand markets outside of Ethereum/OpenSea. These APIs address this gap by providing unprecedented access to this much-requested on-chain data.",

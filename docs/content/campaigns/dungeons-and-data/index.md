# Dungeons & Data

![Dungeons & Data Logo](./images/dnd_logo.png)

The purpose of the Dungeons & Data (DnD) campaign is to empower a wide community of *'Citizen Data Scientists'*, analysts and enthusiasts who can quickly and effectively analyze curated datasets with little-to-no coding and create valuable apps and case studies.

The multi-week campaign consists of activities which include:
- Running daily quizzes
- Running week-long puzzles
- Developing protocol specific content pieces
- Developing graphic designs
- Executing data visualization tasks
- Executing data science tasks
- Developing case studies and apps

While this campaign is focused on developers interested in blockchain technologies and applications, it also includes activities for non-developers or general retail communities.

The general campaign website is: https://dnd.covalenthq.com/

## Challenges
DnD campaign challenges are broken down into *Community* (i.e. non-developer) and *Data scientists* challenges. 
&nbsp;
### Community
Community challenges include:

* **Artist Challenge** - Create an infographic piece, explanation graphics or even an art piece about the protocol. 


* **Writer Challenge** - Create and publish an original article on one of the following topics: 
  - What problems can be solved with the protocol? 
  - Why is blockchain data analysis important?
  - Why is transparency important for blockchain
  - Open topic - pick up your own topic to write about (must be relevant to the protocol)

* **Daily quizzes** - time sensitive, daily, general info quizzes

* **Puzzle Challenge** - fun puzzles involving encoded messages, riddles and clues.

### Data scientists
Challenges geared towards data scientists include:
* **Data visualization** - Pick a dataset provided by the protocol and create an interesting visualization.

* **Data science** - conduct analysis and produce a case study on provided data around areas such as:
  - Median LP liquidity provided
  - Slippage rates
  - Whale concentrations
  - Impermanent loss
  - Flash loans


* **Data app** - Build a MVP for an app using protocol data. For example, https://aavewatch.com/

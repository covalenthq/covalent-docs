# Querying with Primer (Beginner)


## Introduction

Covalent offers the query language **Primer** which makes it easy for users to further process and transform the records in the Covalent API responses for their custom use-cases. Although you can transform and process the records in Javascript or your spreadsheet of choice, learning to query using Primer will make your job much easier.


## Primer intro

Primer has three kinds of query functionality:

1. The basic functionality is a simple `match` feature that allows users to keep or reject certain records based on a criteria.  
2. The intermediate functionality is to combine the operators with logical operators to create sophisticated rule sets.
3. The advanced functionality allows you to build an aggregation pipeline that closely resembles a data pipeline that can not only match/filter records, but also sort, skip, limit and aggregate records.

We use the generic term "record" in reference to the underlying data models available on a supported blockchain: `blocks`, `transactions`, `balances`, `log events`, etc. In the case of `log events`, the data model is even richer and includes the multi-schema business model logic of the underlying smart contract protocol.

This beginner guide is focused on the `match` functionality. The second part introduces more advanced matching criteria and the third part introduces the data aggregation pipeline.


### Comparison with MongoDB

The Primer syntax and functionality is closely modeled after MongoDB - one of the most popular NoSQL databases available today. Although SQL has its uses, we find a JSON-style query language to be a much better fit for the multi-schema, non-relational nature of blockchain data.

<TableWrap>

|MongoDB|Primer|
|---|---|
|Database|Chain ID|
|Collection|Collection (Response)|
|Document|Record|
|Query document|Query document|
|Operator|Operator|

</TableWrap>

The query itself is a well-formed JSON document, which we call a "query document". Besides the slight differences in how we name things, there are no differences in the behavior or functionality of the query system.

## Primer syntax

The basic functionality of Primer is to keep/reject records that match a specific criterion:

### All records

To select all records in a response, you simple pass an empty query document. This is the default behavior.

```json
---
header: Query to include all records
---
{
}
```

### Specific records

You can apply the equality condition to retrieve a specific record. The `<field>:<value>` expression in the query document achieves this:

```json
---
header: Query for a specific record
---
{
    "field_1": "value_1"
}
```

```json
---
header: Query for records with an exact match
---
{
    "sender_address": "0xc0da01a04c3f3e0be433606045bb7017a7323e38",
}
``` 

### Embedded records

It's possible to `match` based on deeply nested embedded documents using the dot notation (`field.nested_field`). The syntax is extensible to infinite depth: `field.nested_field.second_nested_field`.

```json
---
header: Query with dot notation
---
{
    "decoded.name": "ProposalCreated"
}
```

## Querying Compound's Governance

Now we will put to use the Primer concepts we were introduced to in the previous section against Compound's Governance contracts.


<Aside>

The Compound Governance contract is at `0xc0da01a04c3f3e0be433606045bb7017a7323e38`.

The governance contract emits events pertaining to a proposal's lifecycle and voting history of COMP token holders. Here are some of the events that are emitted through this contract:

### About the data

The governance contract emits events pertaining to a proposal's lifecycle and voting history of COMP token holders. Here are some of the events that are emitted through this contract:

* `ProposalCreated` - emitted when a new proposal is created
* `VoteCast` - emitted when a vote has been cast on a proposal
* `ProposalCanceled` - emitted when a proposal has been canceled
* `ProposalQueued` - emitted when a proposal has been queued in the Timelock
* `ProposalExecuted` - emitted when a proposal has been executed in the Timelock


<Aside>
Covalent offers a handy tool if you want to explore the events and their topic hashes emitted by a smart contract.

The `ProposalCreated` event for example, looks like the following:

```json

```json
---
header: Query for a specific record
---
{
    "tx_hash": "0xeee9627ef06eb757e7959093c7ba8e3e4e64b466f286df5e482ff183ed95d25c"
}
```

If you want to filter all records with a specific `sender_address`, the following syntax works:

```json
---
header: Query for records with an exact match
---
{
    "sender_address": "0xc0da01a04c3f3e0be433606045bb7017a7323e38"
}
```

### Embedded records

If you want to match all "ProposalCreated" events that is available inside an embedded document, this syntax with the dot notation works:

```json
---
header: Query with dot notation
---
{
    "decoded.name": "ProposalCreated"
}
```

## Summary 

By succesfuly completing this learning series, you would have been able to match/filter records from Covalent using a specific criteria as expressed with Primer's query syntax. Additionally, you have also used the dot notation query syntax to match/filter records based on embedded fields.

Next in the series, we will learn how to use Primer's query operators.

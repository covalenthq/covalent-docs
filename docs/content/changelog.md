# API Changelog

Every change to our API matters and reflects our belief in one of the following guiding principles which we include as tags on each changelog item:

- `<multichain>` - one unified API for all chains
- `<data-accessibility>` - access to any blockchain data at any time with greater detail.
- `<no-code>` - support for non-devs

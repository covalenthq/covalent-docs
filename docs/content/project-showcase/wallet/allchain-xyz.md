# All chain

### Website

https://allchain.xyz/

<Aside>

"With just a few simple steps on the Covalent API, you can get a wide range of real-time and accurate data such as your account balance, contract, transaction,â€¦ on all chains that we are supporting.
With a useful user interface, Allchain Covalent API will become a must-have tool for Crypto users in the future."

### Use of Covalent API

The data was used in JSON format.

The `/v1/chain_id/address/address/balances_v2/` and `/v1/chain_id/address/address/transfers_v2/` endpoint was used.

SetInterval function is used to recall API once every 30 seconds. This leads to the result that every data is always updating without any user actions.

### Event

The project was built as an independent developer project.

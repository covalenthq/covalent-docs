### Website

&nbsp;

EthBlox is a social platform for users to share their NFTs, join communities, and make friends. With all posts and communication hosted on IPFS.

<Aside>

“The Covalent API is beginner friendly and doesn't take much to set up. The usage of Primer helps us create targeted queries that reduced time taken to query.”

### Use of Covalent API
We used the NFT API endpoints to query metadata from Polygon and transformed the JSON data containing metadata, account information and more, to suit our needs.

### Event
The project was built at [EthGlobal - HackFS 2021](https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/hackfs-winners-announcment/)

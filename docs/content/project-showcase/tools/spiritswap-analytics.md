# SpiritSwap Analytics

### Website

<Aside>

"Using the Covalent API is quick and easy. Our app could easily be used for a different project as well, given the generic approach offered by the Covalent API"

</Aside>

&nbsp;

### Use of Covalent API
We used the [Uniswap Clone Endpoints](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/learn/guides/uniswap-clone/) endpoints for fetching `Token` and `Pool` data for the [SpiritSwap](https://www.spiritswap.finance/) DEX. Additionally, we used the [`Get token balances for address`](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/balances_v2/) for fetching balances and [`Get historical portfolio value over time`](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/portfolio_v2/) endpoint for fetching `Pool` balances.

### Event
The project was built at [#OneMillionWallets - Fantom 2021](https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/omw-fantom-winners/)

&nbsp;

A single wallet that allows analysis of all owned tokens and note making of all transactions across any blockchain.

<Aside>

“Covalent API is a single endpoint for a vast amount of information across different blockchains. It is also easy to use, and very well documented.”

</Aside>

&nbsp;
### Use of Covalent API
The Covalent API was used for the retrieval of several pieces of key information. These are:

- Chains: All Blockchains that the Covalent API supports was retrieved, the user chooses the Blockchain/s their wallet/s is from, and enters the related wallet address. This ensures that as covalent API Blockchain support increases, so does this applications Blockchain support.
- Transactions: All transactions for the users wallet tokens were retrieved between a specified 'to' and 'from' date. These transaction histories are then built upon to keep notes specific to each transaction for future reference.
- Historical By Token Addresses: The value change over 24 hours and over a year was retrieved for each token in the user's wallet. Used to show token value changes for analysis both in the short term and long term for decision making.

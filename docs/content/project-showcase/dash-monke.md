# Dash Monke

### Website
https://monkey-dagger.github.io/

<Aside>

"We like the fact that there is an API for these endpoints, all aggregated. Also, a direct form to try the API."

</Aside>

&nbsp;
### Use of Covalent API
Mainly used the Pricing and Class A endpoints. Specifically, we used the `GET spot prices` and `GET historical prices by address` from the pricing endpoint; and `GET Token Balances`, `GET Transactions`, and `GET Token Transfers`.

&nbsp;
### Event
The project was built at [#OneMillionWallets - Etherpunk 2021](https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/etherpunk-winners-announcement/)

# Get Log Data

Use this tool to download CSV of Contract Logs by Contract Address and by Topic Hashes across the supported blockchains. If you want to write code to do this - use the [`Get Log events by contract address` endpoint](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/events/address/{address}/) and [`Get Log events by topic hash(es)` endpoint](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/events/topics/{topic}/) on the Covalent API.
